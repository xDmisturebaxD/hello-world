# hello-world
An optional description.... Shouldn't be too detailed and yet here I am thinking about it, incredible.
 Well, here I go !
 Hi, My name is Rafael and I'm still... young, yeah.
 This is the first file of many in which I may write about me to... me, sort of... Which is currently considered fine by society and friends(maybe). I want to become an Astronomer ! And discover more about the universe with black-holes being my reason, I already have a little theory of my own about the extent of the infinite universe why it keeps on "growing".
 I also am very curious about the rest of the world too, but traveling is more expensive and time-taking than you could imagine and my current situation doesn't help either so I just have to make my best to help those around me for now, until I take my next step.
  I'm learning this to help a friend of mine and I really hope that I don't break down his hopes about me, I must destroy the lazy me and bring back my old self... my true self. And for that I have begun remembering about myself and how I used to be and slowly re-adapting myself again, for that my next "re-adapting" step is to get back my focus as I can't seem to move straight into an idea and end up thinking about things that confuse my goals.
  Now lets continue the journey !
